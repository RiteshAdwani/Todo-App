## Features:
- When a user clicks on the `+` button, an input box opens up to add tasks to the list.
- If the user types something and presses `enter` key, that item is added to the end of the list.
- If the user types nothing and presses `enter` key, it gives an error message, telling the user to enter a task.
- Once text input is visible, if the user presses the `Esc` key, the text input gets hidden and shows back the + button again.
- On completion of a task, click on the circle on the right most side of the list item and the completed task's text color changes.
- All the tasks of the current day remain in the list till midnight, after that all the tasks are deleted from the list.
